# Connect Four Game

This project implements the classic Connect Four game with a graphical user interface.

## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
